# Arcade-Game---Object-Oriented-Javascript---Udacity
Project for Udacity Object Oriented Javascript Course

In this project I built an arcade game as part of [Object-Oriented-Javascript](https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-javascript--ud015) course on Udacity. The game looks as shown in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxeHV1kt7iU&feature=youtu.be)

I learnt JavaScriptâ€™s object oriented programming features to write eloquently designed classes capable of creating countless instances of similarly functioning objects. I was able to learn variety of ways that inheritance and delegation can be used to create well-architected and performant applications.
