The game looks as shown in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxeHV1kt7iU&feature=youtu.be)\r\n\r\nI learnt JavaScriptâ€™s object oriented programming features to write eloquently designed classes capable of creating countless instances of similarly functioning objects. I was able to learn variety of ways that inheritance and delegation can be used to create well-architected and performant applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installing\r\n\r\nDownload the repository and run the index.html file in browser.\r\n",
